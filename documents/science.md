# 10 Mind-Blowing Science Facts

A collection of facts to spark your curiosity about the incredible universe we live in.

### 1. Your Body is Mostly Empty Space
If you removed all the empty space from the atoms that make up every human on Earth, the entire global population could be compressed into a cube the size of a sugar cube. Atoms are over 99.999% empty space!

### 2. There's a Planet Made of Diamond
About 4,000 light-years away, a star named PSR J1719-1438 orbits a planet that is likely a massive diamond. This "diamond planet" is the crystallized remnant of a once-massive star, with its carbon compressed into a crystalline structure.

### 3. Hot Water Freezes Faster Than Cold Water
This counterintuitive phenomenon is known as the **Mpemba Effect**. Under specific conditions, warmer water can freeze more quickly than cooler water. The exact reason is still debated by scientists, but it might be related to evaporation, dissolved gases, or convection currents.

### 4. A Teaspoon of a Neutron Star Would Weigh Billions of Tons
Neutron stars are the incredibly dense corpses of massive stars that went supernova. The matter inside is so compressed that a single sugar-cube-sized amount of it would weigh more than Mount Everest—about a billion tons on Earth.

### 5. There are More Trees on Earth Than Stars in the Milky Way
NASA satellite-based estimates suggest Earth is home to over **3 trillion trees**. Meanwhile, our Milky Way galaxy is estimated to contain a "mere" 100-400 billion stars. Earth is a lush paradise by comparison!

### 6. You Are Slightly Taller in the Morning
During the day, the cartilage discs in your spine get compressed by gravity from sitting, standing, and moving. When you lie down to sleep at night, these discs rehydrate and expand, making you about 1 cm (0.4 inches) taller by morning. You shrink back down throughout the day.

### 7. Helium Can Defy Gravity and Climb Walls
When cooled to near absolute zero, helium becomes a superfluid. It has zero viscosity, meaning it can flow without losing kinetic energy. It can climb up and over the sides of a glass container, seemingly defying gravity, in search of a warmer area.

### 8. The Human Stomach Gets a New Lining Every 3-4 Days
The hydrochloric acid in your stomach is so powerful that it could dissolve metal. To protect itself from being digested, your stomach lining regenerates at an astonishing rate, completely replacing itself every few days.

### 9. A Single Bolt of Lightning Contains Enough Energy to Toast 100,000 Slices of Bread
The energy in a large, single lightning bolt is immense—roughly 5 billion Joules, or enough to power an average US home for more than a month. That's enough to make a lot of toast!

### 10. We Are All Made of Stardust
Nearly every element in your body was forged in the heart of a long-dead star. Elements like carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen were created in stellar cores and scattered across the universe when those stars exploded as supernovae. This means you, and everyone you know, are literally made of stardust.
